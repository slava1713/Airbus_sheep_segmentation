# Airbus_ship_segmentation

It's a script for Training, Evaluating the model and making EDA based on Airbus Ship Detection Challenge.

## Code Structure

model.py is a script based my architecture of model.

training_script.py is a script of training and making data loaders.

EDA.ipynb is notebook with exploratory data analysis of the dataset.

eval_model.py is a script with code for testing model and visualization of the results.

## Results

From testing model we can see that it understands how to find ships.

What I would update is accuracy of the model by making more complicated architecture of the model and change some hyperparameters.
